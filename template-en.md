## 6. Project Introduction



- Concept(s) & Rationale(s)
 
    ```
  
    The project is both a technical and promotion task to promote usage of Like coin:
    Currently entertainers/presenters of live video streaming shows are controlled by the video platform with high demand of commission fee, control on what the presenters content shall be.  Our project allows live presenters be more independent, and have more options of getting rewarded for their creation and content;  The One Like shop also have shops that are actually commodity in real life, e.g. coffee, food, we are lining up multiple vendors for such activity, and thus encourage the wide spread usage of like coin in normal life, content writers who has gained like coin can use them for consumption of real-life goods and services.
    With the use of like coin, live streaming entertainers will also help to promote like coin as they shall be actively encourage like coin so that their benefit or income from the audiences can also be increased.
    For people who has certain quantity of like coin in their activities of content creation in Matters, or other youtube/blog channel, the like coins on hand can only trade to fiat money in order to use it.  The like coin community shall be a more idealistic model which the like coin owners and community shall be using like coin as currency , this can guide their thought into a way that try not to measure any goods/services in terms of fiat money, but like is the new price list.
    With the project, at one side encourage more audience using like coin, also let live stream entertainers be independent of platform control.
