## 6. Project Introduction

- Concept(s) & Rationale(s)

    ```
    Photo is a powerful media to tells a story in one glance, Hong Kong at this very moment, everything changes day by day, and we don't know what's coming next, at least we can still have a freedom to take a photo, make a snapshot of what we're valued and store it into blockchain to last forever.

    The end goal of this project is create a crowdsourcing curated photo magazine and publishing on ISCN, encourage our stakeholders to vote for their favorited daily photos.
    ```

- Deliverable(s)

    ```
    **IOS app:**
      - Sign up / Login with AuthCore
    	- User able to take a photo
    	- Get metadata from the photo such as location, date time, resolution
      - User able to add a caption
      - Upload and publish the photo and metadata on ISCN
      - User able to like a photo(perhaps needs a centrized infrastructure for storing the data)

    ```

## 7. Work Plan

- Schedule: Operation or Development Roadmap

    ```
    **IOS App development(3 months)**:
        - Build instagram-like app for iOS and photos will be uploaded on ISCN
    ```

- Landing, Promotion or Diffusion Plan

    ```
    **Strategies**:
    1. When user upload their first photo, will get a certain amount of Likecoin for incentive, the deposited Likecoin could be also used for transaction fee for uploading photo on ISCN
    2. Create editorial content and publish on online media
    3. Featuring KOL, celebrties or activists
    4. Blog
    ```

- Maintenance and Upgrade Plan (Optional, for "Applications" and "Infrastructures" proposals only)

    ```
    - Upgrade the APP to supports IOS newer version
    - Upgrade the validator node, if LikeChain has new upgrade
    ```

## 8. Budget
