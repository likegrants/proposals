## 6. Project Introduction

- Concept(s) & Rationale(s)
 
    ```

# Motivations and the problems we are solving
- A lot of webpage/datasets on ipfs lack metadata, thus it's not easy for them to be searched and used.
- An open and decentralized web is in need for more and more people, so we need to design a search engine that supports web3 rss and web3 Creative Commons licence and other standards which has better decentralized features and incentive mechanism.
- The reward of creators and curators are controlled by big companies at present which is not good.
- Many creators are not familiar with new technology such IPFS, so they need someone to help them solve these problems.

# Our product
A decentralized Search Engine for IPFS and using Likecoin as incentive mechanism.

# Features and how solve this problem
- 1350000+ permalinks&datasets are indexed and more is on the way, including Wikipedia, Kaggle datasets, TED, Arxiv, blogs, Matters(an ipfs-blog-community). Free snapshot!
- Reward creators and sharers/curators with Likecoin. For example: search TED
- Users can add metadata for any content, so that it can be searched.
Help store data in Dweb(pin in IPFS etc.)

# why this project is valuable for the LikeCoin community
- We choose Likecoin as incentive mechanism, and it will make likecoin more useful.
- We use likecoin both in web2(like.co) and web3(keplr extention&ledger) way. We will focus on web3 more. And this will help likecoin be better in the future.
- Our product will help the likecoin ecosystem too.
    ```
